# Homebrew hazcod Tap
This is my tap repository so you can use homebrew to install, uninstall and update my projects.

## Installation
If you haven't, install Homebrew: `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

Then install this tap using `brew tap hazcod/homebrew-hazcod`. You can now `brew install` my packages.
